# Zelda Navi's Quest

**Zelda Navi's Quest _Solarus Edition_** is a remake of the original [Zelda Navi's Quest](http://www.zeldaroth.fr),
the 4th fangame by Vincent Jouillat, and the sequel of Zelda Time To Triumph.
The original game was developed in C++ and released in 2014.

This new version is being developed with the [Solarus engine](https://github.com/solarus-games/solarus).
While this is essentially the same game, a lot of details will be improved thanks to the use of Solarus.

The project is currently a work in progress and there is no release date planned yet.
